    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 06, 2024</p>

    <p>Welcome to the DNU Student Council TikTok Analytics tool (the "Service"). This Service is a private tool developed for and used exclusively by the Students' Council of Dnipro National University named after Oles Honchar ("DNU Student Council," "we," "us," or "our") to analyze the performance of its official TikTok account, @dnu.official.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>The Service utilizes the official TikTok API to fetch publicly available performance metrics (such as views, likes, comments, shares, upload date, and duration) for videos posted by the @dnu.official TikTok account. This data is then organized and displayed within a private Google Sheet accessible only to authorized members of the DNU Student Council. The purpose of the Service is solely for internal data analysis to improve content strategy and engagement for the DNU student community.</p

    <h2>3. Intended Use</h2>
    <p>The Service is intended for the sole and exclusive use of the DNU Student Council for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To track and analyze the performance of video content on the @dnu.official TikTok account.</li>
        <li>To generate internal reports on content engagement.</li>
        <li>To inform content creation and strategy for the benefit of the DNU student community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Usage and Access</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Service will only access data from the @dnu.official TikTok account after explicit authorization via TikTok's OAuth 2.0 mechanism.</li>
        <li>The data retrieved includes video performance statistics and metadata as provided by the TikTok API.</li>
        <li>This data is stored within a private Google Sheet, part of the DNU Student Council's Google Workspace environment, and access is restricted to authorized council members.</li>
        <li>We do not share this data with any third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As an authorized user from the DNU Student Council, you are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring that the authorization granted to this Service is legitimate and approved by the DNU Student Council.</li>

        <li>Using the data obtained through the Service in a manner consistent with these Terms and the objectives of the DNU Student Council.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as-is" and "as-available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Service will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that the data obtained will be completely accurate or timely, as it depends on the TikTok API.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the DNU Student Council shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

    <h2>8. Modifications to Terms</h2>
