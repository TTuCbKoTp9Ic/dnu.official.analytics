    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Students' Council of Dnipro National University named after Oles Honchar ("DNU Student Council," "we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with the DNU Student Council TikTok Analytics tool (the "Service"). This Service is a private tool designed for internal analytics of the @dnu.official TikTok account.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Service is designed to collect specific, limited information from the @dnu.official TikTok account via the official TikTok API, only after explicit authorization is granted by an authorized representative of the DNU Student Council through TikTok's OAuth 2.0 process. The information collected includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Video Performance Data:</strong> For each video on the @dnu.official account, we may collect metrics such as view count, like count, comment count, share count.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Metadata:</strong> This includes information such as video ID, video duration, video creation/upload date, and share URL, as provided by the TikTok API.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Information (Limited):</strong> We may access basic public profile information of the @dnu.official account necessary to identify the account and retrieve its video list, such as the account's Open ID or User ID provided by the TikTok API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect personal data from viewers of the @dnu.official TikTok account or any other TikTok users. We <strong>do not</strong> collect sensitive personal information.</p>

        <li>To inform and improve the content strategy for the @dnu.official TikTok account, aiming to better serve the DNU student community.</li>
        <li>To populate a private Google Sheet with the collected metrics for easy access and analysis by authorized council members.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected through the Service is <strong>not shared with any third parties.</strong></p>
